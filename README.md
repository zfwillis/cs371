Assignment 4 Test Cases
Input:
1. Dime, Dime
2. Dime, Nickel, Dime
3. Nickel, Nickel, Nickel, Nickel
Output:
1. 20 cents displayed, drink vended LED on, Change LED off
2. 25 cents displayed,  drink vended LED on, Change LED on
3. 20 cents displayed, drink vended LED on, Change LED off
Rationale:
1. 2 dimes = 10 + 10 = 20, so reached 20 cents to vend but not to have extra change. 
2. 1 dime + a  nickel = 15, so 20 cents not reached yet, then another dime would = 25 cents so drink vended and 25 - 20 = 5 cents of change so change LED on.
3. 4 nickels = 20 cents, so reached 20 cents to vend but not to have extra change.

Reflection:
This assignment was very daunting, and the most challenging part was just starting and realizing that I was definetely capable of doing it.
